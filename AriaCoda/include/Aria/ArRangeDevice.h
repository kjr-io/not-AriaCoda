/** 
    @brief The base class for all sensing devices which return range
    information from the device (mounted on a robot) to an object in
    the environment.

    This class maintains two ArRangeBuffer objects: a current buffer
    (getCurrentBuffer())
    for storing very recent readings, and a cumulative buffer 
    (getCumulativeBuffer()) for a
    longer history of readings.  The maximum sizes of each buffer can
    be set in the constructor or resized later. Range device readings
    are most often represented as a point in space (X,Y) where the
    sensor detected an object.  (Therefore an ArPose object may only
    have X and Y components set).  

    Some devices provide an original set of "raw" ArSensorReading 
    objects (getRawReadings()) (that it used to add data to the current buffer) 
    which may also include extra device specific information as well.
    Not all devices provide raw readings.

    Subclasses are used for specific sensor implementations like
    ArLaser and subclasses for laser rangefinders and ArSonarDevice for the Pioneer sonar
    array. It can also be useful to treat "virtual" objects like
    forbidden areas specified by the user in a map like range devices.
    Some of these subsclasses may use a separate thread to update the
    range reading buffers, and so this base class provides "lock" and
    "unlock" methods which you should use when accessing device data.

    A range device may have an ArRobot object associated with it. A
    range device may also be associated with an ArRobot by calling
    ArRobot::addRangeDevice().  ArRobot provides functions which
    operate on all such associated ArRangeDevice objects.  This is a
    convenient (and thread-safe) way to access all range device data
    without depending on a specific set of individual range
    devices. For example, you can find the closest reading in a box or
    a polar section, no matter if that reading originated from the
    sonar, a laser, or other device.
