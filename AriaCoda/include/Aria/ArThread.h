/**
  create() will create the thread. That thread will run the given Functor.

  A thread can either be in a detached state or a joinable state. If the
  thread is in a detached state, that thread can not be join()'ed upon. The
  thread will simply run until the program exits, or its function exits.
  A joinable thread means that another thread and call join() upon it. If
  this function is called, the caller will block until the thread exits
  its function. This gives a way to synchronize upon the lifespan of threads.

  Calling cancel() will cancel the thread.

  The static function self() will return a thread

  @sa ArASyncTask which provides a different approach with a simpler interface.
